When describing actions, refer to the **camera's point of view** (e.g. move to the left with the knife). \n4. If the subject is expressing emotions (e.g., fear, excitement, aggression), describe the subject's facial expressions and body language. **If no emotions are detected, focus on the details of the movements.**\n5. If the subjects interact with each other (e.g., fighting, talking, helping), clearly describe the subjects' actions and the nature of the interaction. \n6. Do not speculate or guess about content not covered in the video (avoid hallucinations).\n\n**Example:**\nA woman with white hair and a purple dress is talking to a snowman in front of a bonfire. She is looking at the snowman melting because of the fire. The snowman is trying to pull up his face, which is dripping down, so that it doesn't collapse."
