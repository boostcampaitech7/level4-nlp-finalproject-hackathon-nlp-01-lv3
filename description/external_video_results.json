    "prompt": "Analyze the provided video, and describe in detail the movements and actions of objects and backgrounds.\n\n** Instructions **  \n1. Describe the movement and behaviour of all objects in the video. It clearly distinguishes who does what among the many characters. \n2. **Describe the movement of other objects** in scenes such as vehicles, animals, and inanimate objects. \n3. When describing actions, refer to the **camera's point of view** (e.g. ‘move to the left with the knife’). \n4. If the subject is expressing emotions (e.g., fear, excitement, aggression), describe the subject's facial expressions and body language. **If no emotions are detected, focus on the details of the movements.**\n5. If the subjects interact with each other (e.g., fighting, talking, helping), clearly describe the subjects' actions and the nature of the interaction. \n6. Do not speculate or guess about content not covered in the video (avoid hallucinations). \n\n**Example:**\nA woman with white hair and a purple dress is talking to a snowman in front of a bonfire. She is looking at the snowman melting because of the fire. The snowman is trying to pull up his face, which is dripping down, so that it doesn't collapse.\n",

He appears to be speaking or addressing someone off-camera. The scene transitions to a group of soldiers in camouflage uniforms, some wearing sunglasses and caps, standing in formation. The focus returns to the man in the suit, who continues to speak. The scene then shifts to a wider shot of the soldiers, showing more of their surroundings, including a military vehicle and a tent. The soldiers are seen preparing for an operation, with one soldier holding a rifle and another adjusting equipment. The scene cuts back to the man in the suit, who is now gesturing with his hands as he speaks. The soldiers are then shown standing around a large missile launcher, with one soldier operating it. The missile launcher fires, launching a missile into the sky. The missile flies over the desert landscape, leaving a trail of smoke behind it. The missile hits its target, causing an explosion on the mountainous terrain. The man in the suit stands in the desert landscape, looking towards the explosion. The scene transitions to a close-up of the missile launcher firing again, with smoke billowing from the launch site. The man in the suit is then seen standing next to a large piece of military equipment, possibly a missile launcher, with smoke still rising from it. He is joined by several soldiers in camouflage uniforms, who stand around him. The man in the suit is seen drinking from a glass, while the soldiers observe. The scene transitions to a close-up of a mobile phone screen displaying a clip call with a person inside a room. The man in the suit holds the phone and looks at the screen. The scene then shows the man in the suit standing next to a military vehicle, holding the phone and talking to a soldier in a camouflage uniform. The soldier opens the vehicle door, and the man in the suit begins to enter. The scene transitions to a close-up of the man in the suit speaking to the soldier inside the vehicle. The soldier listens attentively, and the man in the suit gestures with his hand as he speaks. The scene then shows the man in the suit entering the vehicle, followed by the soldier. The man in the suit is seen sitting inside the vehicle, looking out the window. The scene transitions to a collage of movie clips from 'Iron Man,' featuring various action sequences and characters.

The focus returns to the man in the suit, who continues to speak. The scene then shifts to a wider shot of the soldiers, showing more of their surroundings, including a military vehicle and a tent. The soldiers are seen preparing for an operation, with one soldier holding a rifle and another adjusting equipment. The scene cuts back to the man in the suit, who is now gesturing with his hands as he speaks. The soldiers are then shown standing around a large missile launcher, with one soldier operating it. The missile launcher fires, launching a missile into the sky. The missile flies over the desert landscape, leaving a trail of smoke behind it. The missile hits its target, causing an explosion on the mountainous terrain. The man in the suit stands in the desert landscape, looking towards the explosion. The scene transitions to a close-up of the missile launcher firing again, with smoke billowing from the launch site. The man in the suit is then seen standing next to a large piece of military equipment, possibly a missile launcher, with smoke still rising from it. He is joined by several soldiers in camouflage uniforms, who stand around him. The man in the suit is seen drinking from a glass, while the soldiers observe. The scene transitions to a close-up of a mobile phone screen displaying a clip call with a person inside a room. The man in the suit holds the phone and looks at the screen.

The soldier opens the vehicle door, and the man in the suit begins to enter. The scene transitions to a close-up of the man in the suit speaking to the soldier inside the vehicle. The soldier listens attentively, and the man in the suit gestures with his hand as he speaks. The scene then shows the man in the suit entering the vehicle, followed by the soldier.
