  prompt: |
    Analyze the provided video and write a detailed description based on the given [SCRIPT].

    ** Instructions **

    1. Do not guess or speculate about anything not covered in the video (avoid hallucinations). Describe only facts.
    2. When describing the movements and actions of all objects in the video, clearly distinguish who is doing what among the characters.
    3. When describing the movement of objects (vehicles, animals, objects, etc.), make sure it matches the script, but do not guess what is not in the video.
    4. When describing movement, **consider the camera angle**, and if emotions are expressed, describe facial expressions and gestures (e.g. ‘move to the left with a knife’).
    5. If the subject is expressing an emotion (e.g., fear, excitement, aggression), describe it through facial expressions, gestures, and dialogue. If no emotion is detected, focus on the details of the movement.
    6. If there is interaction between the characters (e.g., fighting, dialogue), clearly describe the characters' actions and situations(e.g. singing, shouting, snarling, cheering, swaring) with the script in mind.

    ** Example **

    A woman with white hair and a purple dress is talking to a snowman in front of a bonfire. She is watching the snowman melt because of the fire. The snowman is trying to lift his face so that it doesn't collapse.
